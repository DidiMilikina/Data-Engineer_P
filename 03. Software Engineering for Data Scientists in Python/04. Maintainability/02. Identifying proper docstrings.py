Identifying proper docstrings
We covered how to write fully-fledged docstrings. Before writing one of your own, this exercise will help you practice by having you identify a properly formatted docstring.

In this exercise, you'll be using the functions goldilocks(), rapunzel(), mary(), and sleeping_beauty() which have been loaded in your environment.
