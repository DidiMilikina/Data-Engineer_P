Bringing it all together: Festivus!
In this exercise, you will be throwing a partyâ€”a Festivus if you will!

You have a list of guests (the names list). Each guest, for whatever reason, has decided to show up to the party in 10-minute increments. For example, Jerry shows up to Festivus 10 minutes into the party's start time, Kramer shows up 20 minutes into the party, and so on and so forth.

We want to write a few simple lines of code, using the built-ins we have covered, to welcome each of your guests and let them know how many minutes late they are to your party. Note that numpy has been imported into your session as np and the names list has been loaded as well.

Let's welcome your guests!

Instructions 1/4

1
Use range() to create a list of arrival times (10 through 50 incremented by 10). Create the list arrival_times by unpacking the range object.

2
You realize your clock is three minutes fast. Convert the arrival_times list into a numpy array (called arrival_times_np) and use NumPy broadcasting to subtract three minutes from each arrival time.

3
Use list comprehension with enumerate() to pair each guest in the names list to their updated arrival time in the new_times array. You'll need to use the index variable created from using enumerate() on new_times to index the names list.

4
Use list comprehension with enumerate() to pair each guest in the names list to their updated arrival time in the new_times array. You'll need to use the index variable created from using enumerate() on new_times to index the names list.

SOLUTION

1
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10, 60, 10)]

print(arrival_times)

2
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

print(new_times)

3
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[arrival_times_np],new_times) for arrival_times_np,new_times in enumerate(new_times)]

print(guest_arrivals)

4
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[i],time) for i,time in enumerate(new_times)]

# Map the welcome_guest function to each (guest,time) pair
welcome_map = map(welcome_guest, guest_arrivals)

guest_welcomes = [*welcome_map]
print(*guest_welcomes, sep='\n')
